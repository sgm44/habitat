p You can use the <code>engines.node</code> data structure in your app's <code>package.json</code> to specify a version of Node.js. For example:

pre
 code
  |
   {
     "name": "my_app",
     "version": "0.1.0",
     "engines": {
       "node": "6.10.3"
     },
    ...
   }

p The value of this key will be used to determine the version of the Habitat <code>core/node</code> package. For example, the <code>package.json</code> above would result in <code>core/node/6.10.3</code> being injected into your Plan's <code>pkg_deps</code> array.

p Currently only releases of the <code>core/node</code> package will work so if further customizing is required you may need to specify a version of Node.js in your plan as described below. Additionally, only exact versions of Node.js are currently supported, so version constraint expressions such as <code>">= 0.10.3"</code> will not work.

h4 Specifying a Node Version in an .nvmrc File

p You can use an <code>.nvmrc file</code> in your app's root directory to specify a version of Node.js. For example:

pre
 code
  |
   > cat .nvmrc
   6.10.3

p The value of the contents of this file will be used to determine the version of the Habitat <code>core/node</code> package. For example, the <code>.nvmrc file</code> above would result in <code>core/node/6.10.3</ode> being injected into your plan's <code>pkg_deps</code> array.

p If a version of Node.js is detected in your project's <code>package.json</code>, the value in an <code>.nvmrc</code> will not be used.

p Currently only releases of the <code>core/node package</code> will work so if further customizing is required you may need to specify a version of Node.js in your plan as described below. Additionally, only exact versions of Node.js are currently supported, so version constraint expressions or wildcard versions will not work.

h4 Specifying a Node.js Version in Your Plan

p You can set the <code>scaffolding_node_pkg</code> variable in your plan to specify a version of Node.js. For example:

pre
 code
  |
   pkg_name=my_app
   pkg_origin=acmecorp
   pkg_version=0.1.0
    # ...
   pkg_scaffolding=core/scaffolding-node
   scaffolding_node_pkg=core/node/5.6.0

p The value of this variable will be used to determine the Habitat package to satisfy the role of your app's Node.js implementation.

 h1 Build your #{current_page.data.platform} web application with Habitat
 
 p This guide shows how to use the #{current_page.data.platform} scaffolding to build and run your web application with Habitat. It explores how to extend and customize your Habitat package based on some common overrides to the default scaffolding behavior. For the complete reference on how to use the #{current_page.data.platform} scaffolding, see the  #{link_to 'reference topic', "https://github.com/habitat-sh/core-plans/blob/master/scaffolding-#{current_page.data.platform_short}/doc/reference.md"} that accomplanies the #{current_page.data.platform} scaffolding.

 p If there is not an #{link_to 'existing scaffolding','/docs/concepts-scaffolding/'} for your application type, please see the #{link_to 'Create Packages', '/docs/create-packages-overview/'} section of the reference documentation for information on how to create a plan from scratch.
